To keep things very simple, we are not using build system like Maven or Gradle.
So we need to download the sqlite driver jar which can be found here : https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/3.34.0/sqlite-jdbc-3.34.0.jar

There is a nice tutorial here : https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-java/sqlite-jdbc-driver/
